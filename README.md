# Dummy Package

This is a minimal Python package that doesn't do anything useful. It's designed for testing package installation and import processes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
import dummy_pkg
from dummy_pkg import hello_world

message = hello_world()
print(message)  # Outputs: Hello from the dummy package!
```

That's it! This package doesn't do anything else.
